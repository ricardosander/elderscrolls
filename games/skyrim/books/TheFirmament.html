<h1>
The Firmament
</h1>
<blockquote>
by Ffoulke
</blockquote>

<p>
The Stars of Tamriel are divided into thirteen constellations. Three of them are the major constellations, knwon as the Guardians. These are the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief. Each of the Guardians protects its three Charges from the thirteenth constellations, the Serpent.
</p>

<p>
When the sun rises near one of the constellations, it is that constellation's season. Each constellation has a Season of approximately one month. The Serpent has no season, for it moves about in the heavens, usually threatening one of the other constellations.
</p>

<h2>
The Warrior 
</h2>
<p>
The Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation and he protects his charges during their Seasons. The Warrior's own season is Last Seed when his Strength is needed for the harvest. His Charges are the Lady, the Steed, and the Lord. Those born under the sign of the Warrior are skilled with weapons of all kinds, but prone to short tempers.
</p>

<h2>
The Mage
</h2>
<p>
The Mage is a Guardian Constellation whose Season is Rain's Hand when magicka was first used by men. His Charges are the Apprentice, the Golem, and the Ritual. Those born under the Mage have more magicka and talent for all kinds of spellcasting, but are often arrogant and absent-minded.

<h2>
The Thief
</h2>
